# canvas to video
> This is my research about how to convert canvas frames to video file.

Solved it by using [MediaRecorder API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder/MediaRecorder)

Use [HTMLCanvasElement.captureStream()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/captureStream)
to capture stream.
