# dts from js
Setting up your Project to emit .d.ts files

To add creation of .d.ts files in your project, you will need to do up-to four steps:

- Add TypeScript to your dev dependencies
- Add a tsconfig.json to configure TypeScript
- Run the TypeScript compiler to generate the corresponding d.ts files for JS files
- (optional) Edit your package.json to reference the types
