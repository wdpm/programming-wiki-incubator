What is a Scheduler? A scheduler controls when a subscription starts and when notifications are delivered. It consists of three components.

- A Scheduler is a data structure. It knows how to store and queue tasks based on priority or other criteria.
- A Scheduler is an execution context. It denotes where and when the task is executed (e.g. immediately, or in another callback mechanism such as setTimeout or process.nextTick, or the animation frame).
- A Scheduler has a (virtual) clock. It provides a notion of "time" by a getter method now() on the scheduler. Tasks being scheduled on a particular scheduler will adhere only to the time denoted by that clock.

> A Scheduler lets you define in what execution context will an Observable deliver notifications to its Observer.
